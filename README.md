Note for grader: This project is an IntelliJ IDEA project, not an Eclipse project.

Note about data: The data is stored in a txt file called songListData.txt under the directory data.
Each line of the file contains the data for a single song. We use a single back
 slash (\\) to separate the data. For example, if we have A/B/C/1999 at the first line of the data file, then
 A is the name of the song, B is the name of the artist, C is the album of the song and 1999 is the year of the song.
